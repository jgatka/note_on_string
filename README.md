# note_on_string
### A simple python app to help you know your way around the guitar neck

Inspired by exercise 1 in _Vaideology_ by Steve Vai

note_on_string.py is A simple python script for guitarists that will challenge you to play a certain note on a specific string. The app iterates through each "flash card" until there are no combinations left.

**Here's how it works:**
* Fire up the app
* it will pick a note on a string, i.e. "G on the high E string"
* Place your finger on the appropriate fret and play the note
* Press any key and the next challenge will appear
* This process will continue until all note on all strings have been displayed

My recommendation is to go through the entire set of challenges twice. Do it a few times per week and you'll quickly learn your way around the fretboard.
Have fun!
